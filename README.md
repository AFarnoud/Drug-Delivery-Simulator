# Drug-Delivery-Simulator

The solver combines pimpleFoam with lagrangian library which enables one-way and two-way coupling between the fluid phase and the particles. This solver is suitable for respiratory drug delivery applications as well as drug delivery in blood.

Moreover, a utility is developed that provides the knowledge on the destination of the drug based on the initial injection location. With this code we can know based on the injection location of the drug where it will deposit and end in the body. This code could be used for drug targeting in blood or respiratory system.
